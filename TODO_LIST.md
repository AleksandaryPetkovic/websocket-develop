# Feature Todo List 

* Add dispatcher.disconnect() method to JS client.
* Add better support for the client side on_error event.
* Add file handling support so users can upload files directly through
the JavaScript client.
* Add a secure token to private channels to guarantee that only users
who are authorized to access that channel can broadcast messages to it.
* Re-write the JavaScript client. That code is pretty nasty.
